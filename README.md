# 🗨️ Real-Time ChatApp Web Application

> 🚀A simple real-time messaging user interface using plain HTML, CSS, JS, and a Node-driven backend.
> Created by learning alongside a web dev tutorial series.

---

## 📌 Overview

This is a light-weight messaging interface where users can send and receive real-time messages from a browser. 
The backend is implemented using Node.js and WebSocket (`socket.io`) for real-time communication between clients.
The UI has been implemented using straightforward HTML and CSS — without the use of any front-end framework — in order to maintain simplicity and ease of understanding.
⚠️ This project was made for **personal learning** purposes following along with a developer tutorial series and is not intended for public hosting or production.
